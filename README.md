# Interactive Blocksworld Application Showcasing Planning Techniques

This repository contains the **Bachelor thesis of Elia Hänggi** (elia.haenggi@stud.unibas.ch).  
The written report is available as `BachelorThesis.pdf`.

## Project Overview

Fast Downward is a classical planner using heuristic search. It employs advanced planning techniques that are often hard to teach due to complex data structures.  

This project creates an **interactive application** to showcase these planning techniques using **Blocksworld**, a simple and illustrative planning problem. The application is implemented in **Unreal Engine** and interfaces with the Fast Downward planner.

Users can:
- Explore the **state space** themselves  
- Have Fast Downward **generate plans automatically**  
- Learn about **heuristics** and how the planner explores the state space  
- Observe **planning techniques in action**
